# Network

This example tests the module in an existing VPC with multiple subnets in a VPC. To mimic that existing VPC with extra subnets, this code spins up a (network mostly) environment that can be used to test the module.

## Setup

```shell
terraform init
```

## Deploying

```shell
terraform apply
```

## Cleanup

Although these resources cost no money:

```shell
terraform destroy
```
