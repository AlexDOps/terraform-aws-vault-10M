# Network

This example tests the module in an existing VPC. To mimic that existing VPC, this code spins up a (network mostly) environment that can be used to test the module.

# Setup

```shell
terraform init
```

# Deploying

```shell
terraform apply
```

# Cleanup

Although these resources cost no money:

```shell
terraform destroy
```
